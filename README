To compile and run the project run the shell script compile.sh

Extra libraries that you will require:
Data.HashMap
Data.List.Key
WXHaskell

To install WXHaskell on a mac you want to follow the directions here:
http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/MacOS_X

also install utility-ht with cabal.

The shell script will launch the GUI app.

You can also run Maze.hs in GHCI to run any of the code excluding the GUI,
in case you want to see how it works without having to install all the graphical
libraries (which are a huge pain).

Components:
Maze.hs - runs a simple cmdline function that lets you load a maze file and solves
it

MazeGUI.hs - the gui component of the project.

Solver.hs - code that can read mazes from a file and solve mazes using dijkstra's
algorithm.

RandomMaze.hs - generates arbitrary mazes based on a given height and width. All
mazes generated ARE solveable.

Tests.hs - unit tests.
